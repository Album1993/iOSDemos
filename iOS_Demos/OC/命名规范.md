### 1. Informer function


Usually triggers router/management functions.
function examples:



```
delegate.dataHasUpdated()



func dataHasUpdated()

{

  //Someone is informing you that something has happend

}

```


```
// Informer Functions

override func engineStarted()

{

 super.engineStarted()

 handleCarStarted()

}

```

Call back function, inform that something did/will happen and gives you the option to react.

Mostly used as delegate trigged actions, or notification handling functions .


### 2. Management function


Used to unite multiple function to achieve 1 higher purpose without dependency, all the code inside the block will execute.



```

// Management Function

func handleCarStarted()

{

   turnLights(on: true)

   turnAC(on: true

}

```

Reading this function we have all the information we need, execute this functions when the car has started, at this point we don’t care “how” its done rather the “what” it does.


### 3. Router function


Used to unite multiple functions to achieve 1 higher purpose **with some sort of dependency**, the code will execute only when intended


```

// Router Function

private func turnLights(on shouldTurnLightsOn: Bool)

{

  if shouldTurnLightsOn

  {

    turnExteriorLightsOn()

    checkForBurnedBulbs()

  }

  else { turnExteriorLightsOff() }

  // When an if statment has only 1 thing to execute i like to write it

  // at the same line with the "if" "else" word, it makes reading your code more fluent.

}

```


Router **function** mostly **points** to **execution functions** but in some cases can include logic itself only if the code won’t exceed 1 line.

### 4. Execution function

The implementation of the function name.


```
// Execution Functions

  private func turnExteriorLightsOn()

  {

    leftFrontLight .isOn = true

    rightFrontLight.isOn = true

    leftBackLight  .isOn = true

    rightBackLight .isOn = true

  }

  private func checkForBurnedBulbs()

  {

     for lightBulb in bulbs where !lightBulb.isUseable

     {

       Dashborad.(errorType: .lights)

       break

     } 

  }

```


The logic itself could potently be complicated to understand but we already** declared what** the **function does** in the name, the function turns exterior lights on, the function checks for burned bulbs, understanding this may ease locating bugs in the future, and make it easier to add logic to the function without changing it’s name.

Eventually, after implementing these ideas into your application you should have organized objects with informer, management and router functions in your class segment.


```
class Car: Vehicle

{

// Informer Functions

   override func engineStarted()

   {

     super.engineStarted()

     handleCarStarted()

   }

// Management Functions

   private func handleCarStarted()

   {

     turnLights(on: true)

     turnAC(on: true)

   }

// Router Functions

   private func turnLights(on shouldTurnLightsOn: Bool)

   {

     if shouldTurnLightsOn

     {

       turnExteriorLightsOn()

       checkForBurnedBulbs()

     }

     else { turnExteriorLightsOff() }

     // When an if statment has only 1 thing to execute i like to write it

     // at the same line with the "if" "else" word, it makes reading your code more fluent.

   }

   private func handleTurnAC(on shouldTurnACOn: Bool)

   {

     if shouldTurnACOn

     {

       let tempeture = currentTemptureSelected()

       let toggleFocus = currentACToggleFocus()

       startAC(with: tempeture, aimedTo: toggleFocus)

     }

     else { turnACOff() }

   }

}

```

and all the execution/logic in the extension block in the same file.


```
extension Car

{

// Execution Functions

  private func turnExteriorLightsOn()

  {

    leftFrontLight .isOn = true

    rightFrontLight.isOn = true

    leftBackLight  .isOn = true

    rightBackLight .isOn = true

  }

  

  private func checkForBurnedBulbs()

  {

     for lightBulb in bulbs where !lightBulb.isUseable

     {

       dashboard.display(errorType: .lights)

       break

     } 

  }

}

```

The outcome would be a clean short class, readable and easily maintained.


> Remember functions should always be written by the single  responsibly principle.

**Avoid** using "and" in function name: 
 play**And**Minimize()
 load**And**Play()
 This bad practice breaks the single responsibility principle and makes you write code suitable for both situations.

**Avoid** playing guessing games when naming a function:
 moveRedViewIfNeeded()
 This example guarantees future programmers would have to dive inside the function only to understand what the trigger for moving the Red View, which by the way also ambiguous.



```
* and no layoutIfNeeded() is not the same thing, in this case we know that self should re-layout its view's when setNeedDisplay bool is true. This example is universal to swift programming language while your function will probably remain private to your application.
```

### Bonus (food for thought)


The first thing that comes in mind when thinking about readable code is using code convention, they are well known and commonly used, but using them does not necessarily makes your code better, it will make it cross-application but less readable.

> “is” prefix should be used for boolean variables and methods to explain that the returned value is of type Boolean. #CodingConventions

“if” statement always addresses boolean values, then why do we need to declare “is” in each boolean property? why did apple changed swift syntax from **view.hidden** ~> **view.isHidden** ? there’s only one answer I could think of…. because “if view.isHidden” feels natural.

Let’s try implementing “is” prefix by this laws:
		
 * If a boolean property/method of a class used on an instance of that class (public) then “is” prefix is justified.




```
public var isHidden: Bool

{

  return alpha == 0.0

}

if containerView.isHidden

```

* If a boolean property used inside the class (private) then the prefix is redundant.



```
private var positionedVerticaly: Bool

{

  return view.frame.width/2 == centerX

}

if positionedVerticaly

if positionedVerticaly && positionedHorizontally

VS

if isPositionedVerticaly

if isPositionedVerticaly && isPositionedHorizontally

```

* if a boolean property/method **used privately** and publicly then a computed propery should return the private property value.


```
public var isPositionedVerticaly: Bool

{

  return positionedVerticaly

}

if containerView.isPositionedVerticaly

```

We could have used private(set ) and still use it publicly but think about the side effect achieved here, we have implemented encapsulation.


> Encapsulation is **used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class,** preventing unauthorized parties’ direct access to them.


You might be asking your self what about booleans that don’t address self directly, in this case, we should write that property name like so:


```
private var playerIsPlaying: Bool

private var gridConstraintIsEnabled()
```

“is” needs something to refer to: view.isHidden, “is” refer to view. In the example above we have done that same thing, playerIsPlaying, “is” refers to the player.

**Remember**: Developers usually read the code inside the function to try and understand its purpose long before they even bother on reading the declaration of properties.


```
/if playerIsPlaying { }/ opposing to /if isPlayerIsPlaying {}/
```

which of this options sound natural?, I’ll let you decide.
